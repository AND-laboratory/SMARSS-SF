This analysis is for cross-sectional data from the Gen Z Milestones Study
conducted in 2023 with young people aged 16-27 in Australia.
It is a factor analysis of the SMA-RSS questionnaire, and is based on the
following study, Kiekens, et al., 2023
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-022-02474-6

Combine the "concerned/anxious" and "likely" responses for each scenario. 
From Kiekens 2022: "Scores of anxious expectations were calculated for each 
item by multiplying the responses to the two questions, similar to other RS 
measures (Dyar et al.,2016; Pachankis et al., 2008).

# Original Exploration

Kiekens' models from 2022 indicated both a bifactor model fit best from an EFA,
but that unidimensionality was also supported. Below we test CFAs for both
1 and 2 factor models.

Kiekens 2022 explain that 
- *factor 1* "described scenarios in which someone was treated differently or excluded by others
without an explicit cue that this might be related to oneâ€™s sexual orientation (e.g., a situation where someone laughs when they pass you) and perpetrators were more often peers";
- *factor 2* "described scenarios in which there was a more explicit cue that sexual orientation
might play a role in whether someone would be excluded or treated differently (e.g., a situation involving a same-sex partner or a joke about LGBT people). Here, perpetrators were more often adults.

They also tested (with CFAs) both:
- a *bifactor model* - items allowed to load both on a general factor and 
2 group factors where all factor are orthogonal
- a *second-order model* - items load on orthogonal 1st order factors and 
those 1st order factors then load onto a general second-order factor;

         mar=c(3,3,3,3))
```

## 2nd Order

```{r 2orCFA}
# Second order Model without covariances between items
f2order_nocov <- "
RS_f1 =~ HSS1 + HSS2 + HSS3 + HSS4 + HSS5 + HSS6 + HSS7 + HSS8

                              fit.measures = c("cfi", "chisq.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", "df", "rmsea.scaled", "srmr", "ecvi"))
semPaths(fit_f2order_nocov)
```


The bifactor model performs the best. Taking these 6-items from the bifactor model, we ran sex-stratified CFAs using the bifactor model and compared the fit indices for the two groups as a sensitivity analysis given the larger proportion of assigned females at birth in the sample for Study One.

For further elaboration, we will run a sex-stratified and age-stratified CFA using the bifactor model as this was the best fit for the full sample. TO be thorough a 1 factor model will also be run for each.

```{r 1cfa sex-stratified raw}
# Split the data by sex (male = 1, female = 2)
male_data <- subset(data_combined, IdentitySexAnalysis == 1)
female_data <- subset(data_combined, IdentitySexAnalysis == 2)

# Fit the model for males
fit_f1_nocov_male <- cfa(f1_nocov, data = male_data, missing = "ML", estimator = "MLR", se = "robust.mlr")
summary(fit_f1_nocov_male, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
fitmea_f1_nocov_male <- fitMeasures(fit_f1_nocov_male, fit.measures = c("cfi", "chisq.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", "df", "rmsea.scaled", "srmr", "ecvi"))

# Fit the model for females
fit_f1_nocov_female <- cfa(f1_nocov, data = female_data, missing = "ML", estimator = "MLR", se = "robust.mlr")
summary(fit_f1_nocov_female, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
fitmea_f1_nocov_female <- fitMeasures(fit_f1_nocov_female, fit.measures = c("cfi", "chisq.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", "df", "rmsea.scaled", "srmr", "ecvi"))
```

Below is a comparison of the fit measures for ASAB and AFAB for the 1 factor model.

```{r 1cfa sex-stratified comparison}
# Extract fit measures for male model
male_fit_measures <- fitMeasures(fit_f1_nocov_male, fit.measures = c("cfi", "chisq.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", "df", "rmsea.scaled", "srmr", "ecvi"))

# Extract fit measures for female model
female_fit_measures <- fitMeasures(fit_f1_nocov_female, fit.measures = c("cfi", "chisq.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", "df", "rmsea.scaled", "srmr", "ecvi"))

# Create a data frame for comparison
fit_comparison <- data.frame(
  Measure = c("cfi", "chisq.scaled", "pvalue.scaled", "df", "rmsea.scaled", "srmr", "ecvi"),
  Male = as.numeric(male_fit_measures),
  Female = as.numeric(female_fit_measures)
)

# Print the comparison table
print(fit_comparison)
```

The 1 factor model shows a poor fit, lets look at the 2 factor model for the reduced 6-items.

```{r bifCFA sex-stratified male raw}

```
